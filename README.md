# DnD_monster_data

### Objective
Make a repository as a way to practice using git and GitHub where all homebrew monster data made for Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition is in a database that can be easily queried.

### Methodology
Using the Homebrew content covered under the GNU v1.3 License, data is scraped using a Python script with the bs4 library. That data is then transferred to a PostgresQL server.

### Contributions
Contributions are more the welcome! Please be patient with pull requests as one of the objectives for this repository is to practice pull requests amoung other git commands. 

### Vision
Thinking longterm, once this project is complete I plan on expanding the scope of the project by making a machine learning model to predict the frequency and location of monster appearence in Faerun (the world of Dungeons and Dragons). Another possible expansion is taking that model and layering on a GUI of Faerun for players to hover a cursor over and see the possibilites.

### Data
All the homebrew monster data is taken from https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_Monsters and covered in the GNU v1.3 License listed in the DATA LICENSE file.
